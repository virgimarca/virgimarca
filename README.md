### 👋 Hello, World!
I'm Virginia, a tenacious woman in STEM, navigating the intricate world of Data Science and Engineering 🚀. I am currently undertaking a double degree program between the University of Illinois at Chicago and Politecnico di Torino, exploring the frontiers of technology and innovation.

🧠 My fascination lies in the realm of Machine Learning, particularly the development and application of generative models and reinforcement learning. I see data as a vast ocean of potential, waiting to be harnessed to uncover insights and guide decisions.

👩‍💻 As a proud female technologist, I'm committed to bringing diverse perspectives to the table in the creation and application of AI. I believe that each line of code we write is a brick in the foundation of our future, and I'm excited to help shape that future.

In my free time, you might find me at a crocheting, delving into a new book, or advocating for more representation in STEM fields.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in discussing data science, collaboration on exciting projects, or simply want to chat about the latest in tech!
